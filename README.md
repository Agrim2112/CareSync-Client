# CareSync ü©∫

CareSync is a comprehensive health monitoring mobile application built with **Flutter**. It collects vital health data from body-attached sensors, processes the information on a server, and displays real-time stats and alerts on the mobile app. It also includes a logging system for medical records, personalized notifications, and an alarm mechanism to detect and alert abnormalities.

## How It Works

1. **Sensor Data Collection**  

   Sensors attached to the body continuously collect health data (e.g., heart rate, SpO‚ÇÇ, temperature, etc.).

2. **Server Processing**  

   The collected data is sent to a backend server where it is analyzed and processed to check for abnormalities or trends.

3. **Mobile App Display**  

   The Flutter app fetches this processed data via APIs and displays it in an intuitive dashboard along with medical logs and alerts.
